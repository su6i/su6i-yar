# Skill: Screenwriting Frameworks (Technical Encyclopedia)

[Back to README](../../README.md)

Comprehensive technical protocols for the structural design and engineering of narratives for film, video, and automated media in the 2025 ecosystem. This document defines the standards for Structural DNA (3-Act, Hero's Journey), beat-level pacing, and the mathematical modeling of tension arcs.

---

## 1. Structural DNA: The Narrative Skeleton
Standardizing on the most resilient frameworks for technical and creative storytelling.

### 1.1 The 3-Act Engineering Standard
*   **Act I (Setup):** Exposition, Inciting Incident, Plot Point 1. (Standard: 25% of total length).
*   **Act II (Confrontation):** Rising Action, Midpoint (The "No-Return" gate), Plot Point 2. (Standard: 50% of total length).
*   **Act III (Resolution):** Pre-climax, Climax, Resolution. (Standard: 25% of total length).

### 1.2 The Hero's Journey (Monomyth) Protocols
*   **Logic:** Utilizing the 12-stage cycle (Call to Adventure, Threshold, Transformation, Return) to create deeply resonant educational narratives.
*   **Technical Mapping:** Mapping "The Call" to a user's technical problem and "The Transformation" to the acquisition of a new skill.

---

## 2. Beat-to-Beat Pacing & Tension Arcs
Modeling the flow of energy throughout the screenwriting process.

### 2.1 The "Beat Sheet" Standard
*   **The Beat:** The smallest unit of story movement—an action/reaction pair that changes the "Value" of the scene (e.g., from +Positive to -Negative).
*   **Pacing Math:** Targeting a major Value Shift every 2-3 minutes in long-form content to prevent narrative stasis.

### 2.2 Tension Wave Theory
Utilizing a "Sawtooth" wave model for technical tutorials:
1.  **Complexity Spike:** Introduction of a difficult concept (High Tension).
2.  **Simplification/Analogy:** Grounding the concept (Release).
3.  **Repeat:** Building towards the Master Synthesis.

---

## 3. Character Archetype Modeling
Designing "Personas" that facilitate learning and emotional connection.

### 3.1 The "Technical Mentor" Archetype
*   **Goal:** To provide the expertise and tools the "Hero" (the Viewer) needs to solve the problem.
*   **Voice & Tone:** Authoritative, empathetic, and strictly objective.

### 3.2 Archetype Consistency Protocols
Ensuring that character behavior never violates the established "Character DNA" manifest (e.g., a "Stoic Architect" persona should not use slang).

## 4. Technical Appendix: Comprehensive Screenwriting Reference
| Element | Structural Purpose | Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inciting Incident**| Launches the journey | Timestamp @ 5-10% |
| **B-Story** | Secondary emotional arc | Parallelism |
| **Plants & Payoffs** | Logical satisfaction | Correlation Score |
| **The Midpoint** | Reversal of fortune | Timestamp @ 50% |

## 5. Industrial Case Study: Scripting a 15-Minute Technical Masterclass
**Objective:** Building a structural plan for a "Rust Programming" documentary.
1.  **Act I:** The "Memory Safety" problem as the inciting incident.
2.  **Act II:** The struggle with the Borrow Checker (The "Ordeal").
3.  **Midpoint:** A breakthrough in understanding ownership.
4.  **Act III:** Building a high-performance server (The Climax).
5.  **Resolution:** The future of the project.

---

## 6. Glossary of Screenwriting Terms
*   **Exposition:** The introduction of background information.
*   **Inciting Incident:** The event that starts the story's main action.
*   **Climax:** The point of highest tension and the turning point.
*   **Plot Point:** A significant event that turns the story in a new direction.
*   **Subtext:** The underlying meaning or theme beneath the literal dialogue.

---

## 7. Mathematical Foundations: The Golden Section in Acts
*   **Logic:** Placing the "Climax" at the $0.618$ point of the final act to ensure maximum psychological impact.
*   **Timing Math:** Calculating exact page/word counts for each act based on a target duration (1 min = ~130-150 words).

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Performance Verification
*   **Flat Arc:** The story lacks tension or movement. *Fix: Introduce a "Shadow" conflict or a competing technical trade-off.*
*   **Information Dump:** Too much exposition in Act I. *Fix: Move 50% of the exposition into the "Rising Action" phase.*

---

## 9. Appendix: Future "AI Screenwriter" Trends
*   **Dynamic Structural Synthesis:** Utilizing LLMs to combine multiple frameworks (e.g., 3-Act + Save the Cat) into a unique hybrid template for every video.

---

## 10. Benchmarks & Performance Standards (2025)
*   **Structural Integrity:** 100% adherence to milestone timestamps in production.
*   **Retention Correlation:** > 0.85 correlation between "Story Beats" and user engagement hot-spots.
